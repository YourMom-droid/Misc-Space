    "SDS.Dialogue.EdwardSDS.spring_Wed4": "The only person at the top of my game is the boss, and a lot of the work can be delegated to people below me. $0#$b# But that's not safe, it's stupid to put your chances in someone else's hands, and the only person you can really trust in this world is your own abilities. $1",
    "SDS.Dialogue.EdwardSDS.spring_Wed6": "Bosses sometimes intentionally put undercover agents from other families into the company, schedule a bunch of tedious work, say it's a test to prove competence, and when it's over, pull the person out and fire them... $2#$b# It worked, snort, and those undercover agents always worked extra hard. $1",

    "SDS.Dialogue.EdwardSDS.spring_Thu": "The town of Pelican is connected to the internet, but not many people will #$b# use it, rather a lifestyle that complements the backwardness of the place. $0",

    "SDS.Dialogue.EdwardSDS.spring_Thu4": "Lives and social circles that don't blend in don't have a hardcore need to join #$b# in, if it doesn't work out, change it or just do what I do, that's the lesson. $0",
    "SDS.Dialogue.EdwardSDS.spring_Thu6": "Work is work, and life is life. People who mix emotions with rationality won't get #$b# ahead. You'd better not let unnecessary socializing affect your important tasks. $2",
    "SDS.Dialogue.EdwardSDS.spring_Thu8": "It's not that I hate small talk so much, it's just that there's no point in chatting about useless crap. $0#$b# quality dialogue is what makes a good impression on each other, and chatting for the sake of chatting is no different than twittering sparrows. $3",
    "SDS.Dialogue.EdwardSDS.spring_Thu10": "Life here is indeed slow-paced, so slow that you would actually approach me, and the busyness hasn't sapped you of your zest for life so... $0#$b# isn't bad. $1",
    "SDS.Dialogue.EdwardSDS.spring_Fri": "I'm sick of repeating myself over and over again to stupid guys, wasting precious time just for the sake of so-called social niceties... $2#$b# and customers? Clients are different, interacting with them means money and the ability to profit from it. $0",

I thought you couldn't tell at all. $2#$b# Sure, if you were able to climb to the negotiating table with JOJA, I'd face you politely, but right now, I can't think of a reason to be pleasant to you other than the fact that the boss values you. $0",
    "SDS.Dialogue.EdwardSDS.spring_Fri4": "Your farm is fairly stable at the moment, but situations always change.

    "SDS.Dialogue.EdwardSDS.spring_Fri6": "Some people say that this town has things hidden in certain corners with a long history, I?

    "SDS.Dialogue.EdwardSDS.spring_Fri8": "Parties are troublesome for me, especially with people in the industry, where every sentence has to be taken apart to hear the meaning, and after #$b# getting used to analysing other people's words in this way, I subconsciously think about the content of even ordinary chats...

    "SDS.Dialogue.EdwardSDS.spring_Sat4": "What's on the agenda for the weekend? Nothing special, I don't have the leisure to enjoy life, comfort is reserved for people who don't have to work. $2#$b# The higher the ability the greater the responsibility, and correspondingly, the higher the position the more you manage, I'm not prepared to let anyone pull me down, and no one is going to be able to fill in for me. $0",
    "SDS.Dialogue.EdwardSDS.spring_Sat6": "You do seem a little more unique than I thought, no, how about why are you so - simple? $2#$b# All actions are like just for your own pleasure, did you really resign from JOJA? $4#$b# It's a good thing you weren't under my command at the time, or else just keeping you on your toes would probably have been hard enough. $2",
    "SDS.Dialogue.EdwardSDS.spring_Sat8": "The busier you are at work the more you have to watch what you eat, fainting due to lack of energy can't be fun, and if you ever faint and one of our guys picks you up... $0#$b# You're the one who pays anyway, pay once and you'll know to eat in time. $1",

    "SDS.Dialogue.EdwardSDS.winter_Tue6": "It's not all bad what's happening this season, at least the town is getting #$b# quiet now. There's also very few people to be seen on the streets, and I like that. $1",

    "SDS.MoviesReactions.Lucas.reaction_4.AfterMovie": "At the end of the day, things like magic are really intriguing as to what works, and are great for all sorts of jobs... $0#$b# It doesn't even cost anything extra, a book. $3",
    "SDS.MoviesReactions.Lucas.reaction_5.BeforeMovie": "Sensational film? Maybe I should have a little tissue handy... $0#$b# But it's got a good rating, so I guess it's normal to shed even a few tears. $3",

    "SDS.MoviesReactions.Lucas.reaction_8.DuringMovie": "Zombie-like monsters are mostly feared because they're already dead, and it's their bluntness and fearlessness about their desires that scares people. $0#$b# If people weren't afraid of death too or even wanted to bite back...

    "SDS.MarriageMoviesReactions.Lucas.reaction_4.DuringMovie": "Are you interested in the magic in it? $0#$b# I don't believe in that kind of stuff. The difference between $0#$b# so-called magic and deception is simply that one is because of the unknown and the other is built on lies. $2",

    "SDS.MarriageMoviesReactions.Lucas.reaction_7.DuringMovie": "The popcorn tastes ok, but I'd rather have something to drink. The couple's drink at the $0#$b# cinema tastes different, maybe because it's tainted with you? $1",
    "SDS.MarriageMoviesReactions.Lucas.reaction_7.AfterMovie": "Sort of a passable film to pass the time with, but not nearly as interesting to pass the time with you. $0#$b# but if you like it, I'd say it's not bad. $3",

    "SDS.MarriageMoviesReactions.Lucas.reaction_8.DuringMovie": "There are many instances in horror films where characters sometimes operate at a reduced level of intelligence and harden into a funny film, but this one is pretty good... $0#$b# Feeling scared can hold my hand, sweetheart. $3",
    "SDS.MarriageMoviesReactions.Lucas.reaction_8.AfterMovie": "Decent film, but the theatres here probably need to upgrade the picture quality... $0#$b# Aren't those dark screens a blur of picture quality? Mosaic? What's the need for that to be shielded? $0",
    "SDS.MarriageMoviesReactions.Lucas.reaction_9.BeforeMovie": "Old classic films always bring back a bit of memories, honey, have you seen them before? $3#$b#... Me? I have no memories of it, but we can make new ones together and that sounds great. $1",
    "SDS.MarriageMoviesReactions.Lucas.reaction_9.DuringMovie": "Lucas gently holds your hand as she speaks lines from the film, hers voice ringing in your ears with laughter. #$b#... Where are you going? Can you hold my hand and take me with you? $3",
    "SDS.MarriageMoviesReactions.Lucas.reaction_9.AfterMovie": "The plot is much better than those new crappy films, although the restored picture is not as good as the latest effects... $0#$b# Maybe the R&D guys can try to watch it to improve the technology, would you like to see it again? $3",
    "SDS.NPCGiftTastes.Hearts.Lucas.0-3.Lucas": "Uh huh? My dear, you seem to be able to pick up on my preferences quite easily, that's #$b# quite impressive - but you know what I'd prefer to receive more than this kind of gift, don't you?",

    "SDS.NPCGiftTastes.Hearts.Lucas.8-9.Lucas": "You've always been so aware of my preferences, my dear, and who could refuse a gift from such a you? I guess it's a #$b# gift just for me only, right? I'll treasure it ...... So stay for a while? As a return gift, I'll make it pleasant for you.",
    "SDS.NPCGiftTastes.Hearts.Lucas.8-9.Lucas.1": "Sweetheart, I'm really going to be a little jealous if you're so friendly to everyone. But I think it's #$b# better for me to be around you than anyone else, and I think you should feel the same way, shouldn't you?",
    "SDS.NPCGiftTastes.Hearts.Lucas.8-9.Lucas.2": "Why did you give this to me? I thought you already knew all about me, didn't you?",

    "SDS.NPCGiftTastes.Hearts.Lucas.8-9.Lucas.4": "Since it was a gift you prepared for me, of course I'll accept it with great pleasure, and the #$b# very fact that it was a gift from you to me is enough to elevate its value to a level it doesn't belong-",
    "SDS.NPCGiftTastes.Hearts.Lucas.10.Lucas": "Let me see what kind of gift my sweetheart prepared for me? Hmm? It's my favorite. How should I repay you for this gift?",
    "SDS.NPCGiftTastes.Hearts.Lucas.10.Lucas.1": "A gift, I love the thought you put into it, but more than that, I'd like to get something that no one else can have.",
    "SDS.NPCGiftTastes.Hearts.Lucas.10.Lucas.2": "That's a gift that surprises me a little bit now, you should know that I don't really like this #$b# kind of stuff, right? Or did you do it on purpose? Guess I should figure out what to do about it.",
    "SDS.NPCGiftTastes.Hearts.Lucas.10.Lucas.3": "This is a gift? That's a bit of a surprise, after all, I thought you knew what I #$b# liked to be right, it seems we need to get to know each other better, doesn't it?",
    "SDS.NPCGiftTastes.Hearts.Lucas.10.Lucas.4": "I like the way you hand me the gift after you've prepared it, because that #$b# means you care about me, so whatever it is will be something I'll gladly accept.",

    "SDS.NPCGiftTastes.Hearts.Lucas.11-14.Lucas.1": "What a great gift, sweetheart, what can I do to return your affection?",
    "SDS.NPCGiftTastes.Hearts.Lucas.11-14.Lucas.2": "...... It was a bit of a surprise that you had such a gift for me, but don't worry, I guess it's normal to slip up now and then, isn't it?",
    "SDS.NPCGiftTastes.Hearts.Lucas.11-14.Lucas.3": "Are you being mischievous, dear? I have to say, you succeeded - I don't like this stuff, but since you prepared it for me, I'll take it anyway.",

He could have had something else to drink. I don't think he'd mind. $1",
    "SDS.Festivals.summer11.Lucas_spouse": "Seeing you turn up always puts me in a better mood, after all, it can be really irritating to be booked for work or something before I've even met the important people. $3#$b# Darling, stay with me a little longer, before the festivities kick off, and of course, if you want to find me afterwards that's fine too. $6",
